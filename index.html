			<h2>About Us</h2>
		    	<p>Central NJ Infosec is a loose group of security professionals in the Central NJ area. We have monthly meetings that do have rules.</p>
		    <h3>Meetings</h3>
                <p>We meet monthly on the last Wednesday of the month. Meetings include the following format:<br />
                <li>Short "Turbo Talks" from anyone who would like to speak.
                <li>Talks should be between 5-10 min in length.
                <li>Topics can include anything relevent to hacking/infosec.
                <li>Longer talks may be accepted as long as submitted prior to meetings.
                <li><em>If this is your first time, come prepared to speak.</em></p>
            <h4>Participation</h4>
		    	<p>Participation is mandatory for all involved with Central NJ Infosec. We all want to know what you are working on and the best way is for you to <em>speak</em> about it.</p>
            <h4>Presentation Ideas</h4>
                <p>Often figuring out what to present on can be the most challenging. Below are some ideas to help you:<br />
                <li>Present your own material/work
                <li>We love code, demo’s and live examples of work. But make it your own. Don’t give us a 101 on a topic that any of us could just lookup ourselves or read an already written how-to on.
                <li>It doesn’t have to be finished worked
                <li>If you’ve shown you’re doing your own research but are stuck, come talk to us and we’ll likely be able to help!
                <li>No book reports
                <li>Don’t tell us all about someone elses research that you read and now are regurgitating to us. Expand on it! Add to it!</p>
            <h3>Out of Town?</h3>
                <p>From out of town but want to join a meeting? Great! We would love to have you. Presentation is not required for you, but we would still love to hear what you are up to.</p>
